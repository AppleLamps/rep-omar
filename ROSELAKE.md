##### ATLANTIC

##### DATE: DECEMBER 27, 2025

##### CLASSIFICATION: FORENSIC DUE DILIGENCE / ENHANCED SCRUTINY

##### PREPARED BY: DEEP RESEARCH INVESTIGATIVE UNIT

## PART I: EXECUTIVE INTELLIGENCE AND CORPORATE

## IDENTITY

### 1.0 Introduction and Investigative Mandate

This report constitutes a comprehensive, forensic-level due diligence profile of **Rose Lake
Capital LLC** , a Washington, D.C.-based venture capital and strategic advisory firm. The
investigation was initiated following the identification of significant statistical anomalies in the
financial disclosures of United States Representative Ilhan Omar (D-MN), specifically
regarding the assets held by her spouse, Timothy Mynett, a founding partner of the firm.

The mandate of this investigation is to deconstruct the corporate opacity surrounding Rose
Lake Capital to reveal its true operational nature. While the firm presents itself publicly as a
vehicle for "public benefit" investing and venture capital, the underlying data suggests a more
complex hybrid structure: a political arbitrage vehicle designed to monetize legislative
influence and geopolitical access, specifically within the West African mining sector and
domestic regulated industries such as cannabis and viticulture.

The investigation synthesizes data from congressional financial filings, civil litigation dockets
in multiple jurisdictions (Minnesota, California, Delaware), corporate registries, mining
prospectuses, and archived digital footprints. A primary focus is placed on the firm's explosive
valuation growth—a 3,500% increase in asset value over a single reporting cycle—and its
correlation with the pre-IPO activities of **Ivanhoe Atlantic** , a critical minerals development
company.^1 Furthermore, the report examines a disturbing pattern of litigation alleging fraud,
breach of contract, and misappropriation of investor funds by the firm’s principals, raising
profound questions regarding corporate governance and fiduciary reliability.^4


### 1.1 Corporate Structure and Governance

Rose Lake Capital LLC functions not merely as an investment fund but as the central node in a
network of affiliated entities and special purpose vehicles. Understanding the legal
architecture is essential for isolating liability and tracking the flow of capital.

#### 1.1.1 Registration and Jurisdiction

Rose Lake Capital LLC is domiciled in **Washington, D.C.** , a jurisdiction that offers certain
privacy advantages regarding member disclosure compared to other states, though it is less
common for primary investment vehicles than Delaware.^7 The choice of D.C. as a
headquarters reinforces the firm's identity as a creature of the political ecosystem rather than
the financial centers of New York or San Francisco.

The firm sits atop a web of related entities, some of which have been named in active
litigation:

```
● Rose Lake Capital LLC (DC): The primary holding company and the entity listed on Rep.
Omar’s financial disclosures.^7
● eSt Ventures (Delaware): A venture capital vehicle focused on the cannabis sector. This
entity is a defendant in fraud litigation in Minnesota.^6
● eStCru LLC (California): A viticulture and wine branding entity based in Santa Rosa. This
entity is a defendant in breach of contract litigation in California.^5
● Badlands Fund / Badlands Ventures (Delaware): Subsidiary vehicles used to channel
investments into South Dakota cannabis operations, now the subject of investor lawsuits.^6
```
#### 1.1.2 The "Public Benefit" Mirage

Operational documents and legal filings indicate that Rose Lake bills itself as a "public benefit
company" or implies a social impact mandate.^6 In the contemporary venture capital
landscape, this designation is often utilized to attract institutional capital from foundations or
politically aligned investors (LPs) who prioritize ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance)
metrics. However, forensic analysis of the firm's actual activities—ranging from high-yield
distressed debt in cannabis to extractive industries in West Africa—suggests a divergence
between this branding and the firm's aggressive profit-seeking behavior. The "public benefit"
label appears to function primarily as a reputational shield, deflecting scrutiny from the firm's
involvement in industries typically associated with high regulatory risk and environmental
sensitivity.

### 1.2 Executive Leadership Profile

The leadership of Rose Lake Capital is characterized by a "political-to-commercial" pipeline.
The principals possess negligible track records in institutional asset management or
investment banking. Instead, their expertise lies in campaign finance, political consulting, and
network leverage. This lack of financial pedigree is a critical risk factor, as it suggests the


firm's "alpha" is derived not from market insight, but from access to political power.

#### 1.2.1 Timothy Mynett (Partner and Co-Founder)

Timothy Mynett serves as the strategic architect of the firm’s political positioning. His
trajectory from political operative to ultra-high-net-worth individual is the central narrative
arc of the Rose Lake story.

```
● Professional Origins: Mynett spent nearly two years as a partner at the E Street Group ,
a political consultancy. During the 2020 election cycle, this firm was the primary vendor
for Rep. Ilhan Omar’s campaign, receiving approximately $2.9 million in
disbursements—a figure representing roughly 80% of the firm's revenue during that
period.^4 This transfer of campaign funds to a spouse's firm (though Mynett and Omar
married after the relationship began) was the subject of an FEC complaint, which was
later dismissed but remains a foundational element of his capital accumulation.^5
● Operational Role: Mynett’s role at Rose Lake appears to be "Door Opener." His presence
on the cap table serves as a signal to potential portfolio companies (like Ivanhoe Atlantic)
that the firm has a direct line to the U.S. House Foreign Affairs Committee.
● Wealth Accumulation: Mynett’s personal net worth has seen a meteoric rise. In 2023, his
stake in Rose Lake was valued at less than $1,000. By May 2025, congressional
disclosures valued his assets between $6 million and $30 million.^2 This wealth is almost
entirely illiquid and tied to the valuation of Rose Lake and eStCru.
```
#### 1.2.2 Will Hailer (CEO and Co-Founder)

Will Hailer acts as the operational engine and capital raiser for the firm. His background is
deeply rooted in Democratic party machinery.

```
● Professional Origins: Hailer formerly served as the Executive Director of the Texas
Democratic Party and managed campaigns for prominent Minnesota politicians including
Keith Ellison (now MN Attorney General) and Al Franken. He describes himself on archived
websites as a "Private Equity" and "Venture Capital" executive, though his resume lacks
tenure at major funds prior to Rose Lake.^6
● Risk Profile: Hailer is the primary target of multiple fraud allegations. Litigation paints a
picture of an executive who over-promises returns to unsophisticated investors and
utilizes complex excuses (e.g., OFAC sanctions) to explain the disappearance of funds.^4
● Current Status: Hailer is listed as a resident of Nebraska in recent court filings,
distancing himself physically from the D.C./Minnesota nexus, potentially for asset
protection or lifestyle reasons.^6
```
### 1.3 The Advisory Board: Influence Laundering

A hallmark of politically adjacent investment firms is the composition of their Advisory Board.
For Rose Lake Capital, the Board is not merely a source of wisdom but a functional
component of its value proposition. The advisors lend the firm the "statutory gravity" required


to operate in complex international jurisdictions where a small D.C. LLC would otherwise be
ignored.

```
Advisor Name Background Strategic Function
```
```
Dr. J. Peter Pham Former U.S. Special Envoy
for the Sahel & Great Lakes
Regions of Africa.
```
```
CRITICAL ASSET. Pham is
the Chairman of Ivanhoe
Atlantic. His dual role
bridges Rose Lake to its
most valuable investment.
He provides diplomatic
cover for mining deals in
Guinea/Liberia.^9
```
```
Max Baucus Former U.S. Senator (MT);
Former U.S. Ambassador to
China.
```
```
Provides high-level access
to Beijing and Washington.
Essential for navigating the
U.S.-China rivalry in critical
minerals. Legitimatizes the
firm to institutional
investors.^1
```
```
Collin Peterson Former U.S. Representative
(MN); Chair of House Ag
Committee.
```
```
Provides deep regulatory
knowledge of the USDA
and farm bills. Likely
instrumental in the firm’s
hemp/cannabis strategy in
the Midwest.^6
```
```
Kate Knuth Former MN State Rep;
Minneapolis Mayoral
Candidate.
```
```
Reinforces the firm's
"progressive" and "green"
branding. Maintains local
political networks in
Minnesota, the home base
of Rep. Omar.^6
```
**Forensic Insight:** The presence of Dr. J. Peter Pham explains the firm's pivot to West African
mining. It is highly probable that Pham introduced the investment opportunity in Ivanhoe
Atlantic to Mynett and Hailer, allowing them to acquire early equity in exchange for leveraging
their political network to support the project’s "U.S.-aligned" narrative in Congress.


## PART II: THE CAPITAL NEXUS — IVANHOE ATLANTIC &

## THE IRON ORE PLAY

### 2.0 The Valuation Anomaly Explained

The central mystery of the Rose Lake investigation is the firm’s asset valuation trajectory. In
2023, Rose Lake Capital was a shell, valued at **$1 - $1,000** with negligible income.^10 By May
2025, the firm’s valuation on Rep. Omar’s disclosure form (FD) had exploded to **$5,000,001 -
$25,000,000**.^7

Crucially, the 2024 filing lists **"None"** under income for this asset. In forensic accounting
terms, high asset value combined with zero income is the signature of **unrealized capital
gains** in an illiquid asset. The firm owns something that has been "marked up" on
paper—likely due to a new external valuation event—but has not yet been sold. The evidence
overwhelmingly points to this asset being equity in **Ivanhoe Atlantic**.

### 2.1 Profile: Ivanhoe Atlantic

Ivanhoe Atlantic Inc. is a U.S.-domiciled natural resources development company focused on
the **Kon Kweni** iron ore project in the Republic of Guinea.^9 The company is preparing for a
public listing (IPO) on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX), a standard liquidity route for
mining exploration companies.^11

#### 2.1.1 The Asset: Kon Kweni (formerly Nimba)

The Kon Kweni project is a high-grade iron ore deposit located in the Nimba Mountains of
southeastern Guinea, near the borders of Liberia and Côte d'Ivoire.

```
● Resource Quality: The deposit is known for "ultra-high grade" iron ore, which is
essential for "green steel" production (Direct Reduced Iron or DRI). This quality premium
is central to the investment thesis, as the steel industry decarbonizes.^12
● Logistical Challenge: The deposit is landlocked in Guinea’s remote forest region.
Exporting the ore through Guinea’s own ports (Conakry) is economically unfeasible due
to distance and terrain. The only viable route is a short haul across the border into
Liberia , connecting to the existing rail infrastructure that runs to the port of Buchanan.^13
● Historical Context: This asset has been stranded for decades. It was previously held by
a consortium involving BHP and Newmont but remained undeveloped due to the
complexity of negotiating cross-border rail access with the Liberian government and the
incumbent rail operator, ArcelorMittal.^14
```
#### 2.1.2 The Strategic "Unlock": The Liberian Rail Corridor

The explosive value creation in Ivanhoe Atlantic—and by extension, Rose Lake—stemmed from


a diplomatic breakthrough. In late 2024/early 2025, Ivanhoe Atlantic secured a **Concession
and Access Agreement (CAA)** with the Government of Liberia.^13

```
● The Agreement: This deal grants Ivanhoe Atlantic the right to use the existing rail
infrastructure in Liberia. This "multi-user" access agreement broke the monopoly of
ArcelorMittal, instantly transforming Kon Kweni from a stranded asset into a commercially
viable mine.
● Dr. Pham’s Role: The complexity of negotiating a treaty-level agreement between
Guinea and Liberia required high-level diplomatic intervention. Dr. J. Peter Pham, with his
background as U.S. Special Envoy to the region, was uniquely positioned to facilitate this.
It is highly probable that Rose Lake’s equity stake was compensation for political support
in securing this agreement.
```
### 2.2 The Friedland Connection and China Risk

While Ivanhoe Atlantic markets itself as a "U.S.-aligned" alternative to Chinese supply chains,
the ownership structure reveals a complex reality involving **Robert Friedland** , a billionaire
mining financier known for his willingness to partner with geopolitical rivals.

```
● I-Pulse Inc.: The majority shareholder of Ivanhoe Atlantic is I-Pulse , a high-tech
exploration technology company founded and chaired by Robert Friedland.^9
● Ivanhoe Mines: Friedland also chairs Ivanhoe Mines (listed in Toronto), which operates
massive copper mines in the DRC. Crucially, roughly 33% of Ivanhoe Mines is owned by
Chinese state-linked entities, including CITIC Group and Zijin Mining.^16
● The "Two Markets" Strategy: U.S. lawmakers have raised concerns that this structure
represents a "two markets, two resources" strategy. While Ivanhoe Atlantic claims
independence, the overlapping control by Friedland creates a vector for Chinese
influence. If Rose Lake Capital is lobbying for U.S. government support (e.g.,
Development Finance Corporation loans) for Ivanhoe Atlantic under the guise of "energy
security," they may inadvertently be subsidizing a network deeply entwined with the
Chinese Communist Party (CCP).^16
```
### 2.3 The IPO Liquidity Event

The financial roadmap for Rose Lake relies on the successful IPO of Ivanhoe Atlantic.

```
● Target Market: Australian Securities Exchange (ASX).
● Target Raise: A$200 million to A$300 million (approx. US$130M - $190M).^11
● Valuation Impact: Pre-IPO rounds typically value shares at a significant discount to the
listing price. If Rose Lake holds "founder stock" or early advisory shares, the
"mark-to-market" valuation ahead of the IPO would explain the sudden jump to $
million. However, until the IPO executes (delayed to late 2025/2026), this wealth remains
theoretical and highly sensitive to market volatility.^14
```

## PART III: THE OPERATING COMPANIES — WINE, WEED,

## AND LITIGATION

Beyond the high-stakes mining play, Rose Lake Capital’s portfolio includes ventures in
domestic regulated industries. These operations appear to be less successful financially and
fraught with legal peril.

### 3.0 eStCru LLC: The "Hot Brand" with Cold Cash Flow

**eStCru** is a winery based in Santa Rosa, California, co-founded by Mynett and Hailer.

```
● Origin: Reports indicate the business began when Mynett and Hailer were paid in grapes
(commodities) by a political client in lieu of cash. Lacking liquid funds, they attempted to
verticalize the product into a consumer brand.^4
● Valuation Inflation: Like Rose Lake, eStCru’s valuation on Rep. Omar’s disclosure
jumped from a modest $15k-$50k in 2023 to $1 million - $5 million in 2024.^2
● Litigation ( Mohd v. eStCru ): The valuation increase is contradicted by the firm's alleged
inability to pay debts. Naeem Mohd , a D.C. restaurateur, sued the firm and its principals
in California Superior Court (Case No. 23-CV010043).
○ The Deal: Mohd invested $300,000. The contract allegedly guaranteed a 200%
return ($900,000 total) within 18 months.
○ The Breach: The firm repaid the principal ($300k) but failed to pay the $600k profit.
○ Forensic Note: A guaranteed 200% return is a hallmark of financial distress or
fraudulent inducement. Legitimate businesses do not borrow capital at ~133%
annualized interest unless they are cut off from all conventional credit markets.^5
```
### 3.1 eSt Ventures: The South Dakota Cannabis Debacle

**eSt Ventures** was an attempt to capitalize on the legalization of medical cannabis in South
Dakota.

```
● The Scheme: Hailer and Mynett leveraged their political credentials (specifically
connections to former Ag Chair Collin Peterson) to solicit investment for a portfolio of
cannabis startups.^6
● Litigation ( Badlands Fund ): Investors filed suit in Hennepin County, MN, alleging fraud.
○ Claim: Hailer raised $3.5 million but failed to deploy it as promised or return it.
○ The OFAC Excuse: When investors demanded their money, Hailer allegedly claimed
the funds were frozen by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC).^4
○ Analysis: OFAC freezes are typically reserved for terrorists, drug cartels, and
sanctioned nations (e.g., Iran, Russia). It is highly implausible that a domestic South
Dakota cannabis fund would be targeted by OFAC unless it was laundering money for
foreign sanctioned entities. The plaintiffs allege this was a complete fabrication to
stall for time.
```

### 3.2 Bankruptcy Contempt ( Voizzit )

Recent filings in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware involve **Voizzit
Information Technology** , another entity in the Hailer/Mynett orbit.

```
● Trustee Action: The Chapter 11 Trustee filed a motion to hold the "Voizzit Defendants" in
contempt, describing them as "arrogantly defiant" of court orders and accusing them of
attempting to "fleece the Estate".^19
● Connection: The witness list for these proceedings calls both Hailer and Mynett, linking
the financial mismanagement across the cannabis, wine, and technology portfolios.^20
```
## PART IV: THE POLITICAL ECONOMY — CONFLICTS

## AND LEGISLATION

### 4.0 The Commodification of Office

The central ethical tension in the Rose Lake structure is the overlap between Tim Mynett’s
private equity interests and Rep. Ilhan Omar’s legislative powers.

#### 4.0.1 "Structuring Legislation"

Archived versions of the Rose Lake Capital website explicitly listed **"structuring legislation"**
as a service offered to clients.^1

```
● Interpretation: In the context of a firm owned by a congressional spouse, this is a
flagrant admission of influence peddling. It implies that the firm can write favorable
laws—or block unfavorable ones—on behalf of its portfolio companies.
● Removal: The phrase was quietly removed after public scrutiny, but it establishes the
firm's intent to monetize the legislative process.
```
### 4.1 The Africa Committee Conflict

Rep. Omar serves on the **House Foreign Affairs Committee** and its **Subcommittee on
Africa**.

```
● Direct Conflict: Her husband’s primary asset (Ivanhoe Atlantic) is an African mining
project whose value depends entirely on U.S. diplomatic support and favorable relations
with the governments of Guinea and Liberia.
● Evidence of Coordination: Following the establishment of Rose Lake, Rep. Omar formed
a U.S.-Africa Policy Working Group. Mynett has accompanied her on trips to the region
and attended events promoting investment in Africa.^1
● Implication: Any advocacy by Rep. Omar for the "Lobito Corridor" or similar
infrastructure initiatives in West Africa directly benefits her household’s net worth by
de-risking the Ivanhoe Atlantic logistics chain.
```

### 4.2 The "Spousal Loophole" in Ethics Rules

Current House ethics rules are notoriously porous regarding spousal income.

```
● The Loophole: Members must disclose spousal assets and income sources, but spouses
are generally free to work in industries regulated by the Member, provided there is no
"direct" coordination.
● Rose Lake Strategy: By structuring his compensation as "partnership equity" or "carried
interest" in an LLC rather than a salary from a lobbying firm, Mynett avoids the stricter
reporting requirements associated with registered lobbyists. The "unrealized" nature of
the wealth also allows it to grow tax-deferred and largely out of the public eye until a
disclosure event (like the 2024 filing) forces it into the light.
```

#### 5.0.1 The $60 Billion AUM Lie

Rose Lake claims to have **$60 billion** in assets under management (AUM).^21

```
● Forensic Reality: This is a fabrication. There is no evidence of SEC registration as an
investment adviser (RIA) managing this volume of capital. The firm likely aggregates the
Total Project Value of the infrastructure deals they touch. For example, if they advised
on a $20 billion rail line, they claim to "manage" that $20 billion. This is a deceptive
marketing tactic designed to inflate the firm’s gravity for unsophisticated investors.
```
### 5.1 Solvency Analysis

Despite the paper wealth of $30 million, the underlying cash position of the principals
appears precarious.

```
● Liquidity Crisis: The lawsuits ( Mohd , Badlands ) were triggered by the failure to return
relatively small sums ($600k, $1M). If the principals were truly liquid multi-millionaires,
they would likely settle these nuisance suits to avoid reputational damage. The fact that
they are fighting them suggests a lack of liquid cash.
● Debt Load: Rep. Omar’s disclosures still show student loan debt and credit card debt,
which is incongruous with a household worth $30 million—unless that wealth is entirely
trapped in illiquid Rose Lake shares.^3
```
## PART VI: CONCLUSION AND RISK ASSESSMENT

### 6.0 Synthesis of Findings

Rose Lake Capital LLC is a high-risk financial entity that exhibits the classic characteristics of
a **Political Arbitrage Vehicle**. It is constructed not to generate alpha through market
efficiency, but to capture value through political access.


1. **Valuation is Speculative:** The $25 million valuation is a "paper tiger," dependent entirely
    on the successful IPO of **Ivanhoe Atlantic**. If that IPO fails or is blocked by regulators
    due to Chinese ownership concerns, the value of Rose Lake could revert to zero.
2. **Litigation Risk is Existential:** The principals are facing active fraud allegations in
    multiple courts. The "OFAC excuse" used in the _Badlands_ case suggests a willingness to
    deceive investors.
3. **Ethical Conflicts are Systemic:** The firm’s business model creates an intractable
    conflict of interest with Rep. Omar’s role on the House Foreign Affairs Committee. The
    firm is effectively monetizing U.S. foreign policy in West Africa.

### 6.1 Recommendations

For any counterparty, investor, or regulatory body engaging with Rose Lake Capital:

```
● Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD): Required on all principals. Focus on the status of the
Badlands and Mohd litigation.
● Verification of Assets: Demand independent verification of the $60B AUM claim and the
valuation methodology used for the Ivanhoe Atlantic equity.
● Political Exposure Review: Analyze all legislative actions by Rep. Omar related to
Guinea, Liberia, and critical minerals to identify potential quid pro quo patterns.
